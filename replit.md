# AI Process Readiness Assessment

## Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to assess an organization's readiness for AI process implementation. It guides users through a questionnaire across six key dimensions, providing visual analytics, scoring, and actionable recommendations. The tool aims to help organizations understand their AI adoption preparedness, generate comprehensive reports (including PDF exports), and offer industry benchmarking. The ultimate goal is to facilitate smoother AI integration and strategic planning.

## Recent Changes (October 19, 2025)
-   **Scroll Behavior Complete Rewrite**: Implemented robust scroll functionality across all pages using direct scrollTop assignment:

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
The application uses the Streamlit framework for rapid web development, prioritizing Python-native UI. Plotly is used for interactive visualizations, especially radar charts, due to its seamless integration with Streamlit. Custom CSS is embedded for styling, featuring a pastel color palette for different dimensions, card-based layouts, and a fixed header with progress indicators on assessment pages. The user flow involves initial information collection with email validation, auto-scrolling to questions, and a feedback collection form.

### Backend
The backend employs a modular Python architecture with `app.py` as the controller, `data/dimensions.py` for question definitions, and `utils/scoring.py` for business logic. The assessment model evaluates readiness across six dimensions: Process Maturity, Data Readiness, Technology Infrastructure, People & Skills, Leadership & Strategy, and Change Management. Questions use a 1-5 scale with context-specific labels. Scoring involves averaging dimension scores, calculating simple percentage out of 30 max (total/30)*100, and categorizing into readiness bands (Not Ready, Emerging, Ready, Advanced). Streamlit's session state manages ephemeral data, while PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy handles persistent storage for organizations, users, and assessment results.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL is the chosen database, managed via SQLAlchemy ORM. It stores organizations, users, and assessment results. Static dimension and question data are defined in Python dictionaries.

### Features
-   **AI Chat Assistant**: OpenAI-powered conversational assistant on the results page that provides personalized insights and answers questions about assessment results. Uses GPT-5 with context-aware responses based on user's scores and readiness level.
-   **Report Generation**: Exports PDF and text reports using ReportLab and PIL, including executive summaries, radar charts, detailed analyses, and company branding.
-   **Results Display**: Presents an interactive scoring model table that visually highlights the user's readiness level.
-   **Branding Customization**: Allows users to upload a custom logo, set a primary brand color for UI theming, and define the company name, all persistent via session state.
-   **Industry Benchmarking**: Compares organizational readiness against various industry benchmarks (e.g., Small Business, Enterprise, Technology Leaders) with visual indicators.
-   **Recommended Actions**: Provides holistic, insightful analysis of each dimension with acknowledgment of strengths and weaknesses, specific bullet-point recommendations, and a soft plug for complimentary 45-minute consultation regardless of score.
-   **Request Assistance**: A feature on the results page allows users to request professional support from T-Logic.
-   **Navigation**: Includes auto-scrolling, a progress indicator, and a light blue "See Recommended Actions" button below the scoring table that scrolls to the Recommended Actions section.
